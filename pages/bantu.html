              Across all tribes, child birth is seen as a blessing and newborns are welcomed with song, dance and appropriate rituals
              such as child naming. Traditionally among the Kikuyu, people would wait outside anxiously during a birth.
              
              The arrival of a baby girl is announced with four ululations, and five for a baby boy. While this custom is now
              impractical given that babies are born in hospitals, it is still held dear by elder women such as grandmothers who still
              fulfil that requirement the first time they meet the baby- by ululating appropriately.
              
              some bantus believe in shaving a babyâ€™s hair after a few days of birth- always a
              preserve of the mother in law- to keep off bad omens. Most bantu tribes would frown at todayâ€™s trend of having
              ultra sounds to check the sex of the baby before birth- as then it was taboo to discuss or speculate about an unborn
              baby in case you â€˜jinxed itâ€™.
              
              Among the Kikuyu child naming is systematic and has stood the test of time. The first born son is always named after his
              paternal grandfather and the first born daughter her paternal grandfather.
              
              The third and fourth born children are named after maternal grandparents and so forth. Among the Luo for example, a
              child is named after the time of day they were born or after whatever was happening at that time such as a storm, famine
              etc.

              Many bantu tribes give high value to coming of age rituals which are mostly signified by circumcision. Circumcision for boys is however an important step marking transition from boyhood to adulthood. In the past,
              circumcision was done at by an experienced elder by the river very early in the morning, with the cold water serving as
              the anesthetic. The influx of modernity has watered down these rituals and many boys find themselves in hospitals for this important
              step. One of the tribes that continue to embrace the traditional way of doing things is the Bukusu of Western Kenya.
              
              The initiation ceremony is usually colorful and elaborate. The boys to be circumcised exchange a chicken for two bells
              at the local blacksmith days before the ceremony.
              
              Each boy then goes around the homes of his relatives and friends sounding the bells and thus formally inviting them to
              the ceremony. He also appoints a maternal uncle to â€˜stand with himâ€™ during the process.
              
              On the day of the ceremony the boys go down to the river where the appointed uncles smear them with mud and puts grass
              on their head to signify communion with their ancestors. The initiate then walks back home, naked, and is circumcised in
              the presence of his family and friends.
              
              One is required to show utmost bravery in the face of pain and when done is showered with lots of gifts from everyone
              present. The newly circumcised are then kept in isolation for healing, usually for two weeks after which they graduate
              into manhood.

              Marriage is one of the happiest times in a community. Each bantu tribe is linked to traditions that are
              followed during marriage and most remain relevant to date.
              
              At the center of marriage rituals is the paying of dowry, or bride price. Even if the couple will wed in a Christian
              church ceremony, proper procedure leading up to that must be followed.
              
              For many bantu tribes, after two young people decide to get married parents and elders promptly get involved.
              Generally, the groomâ€™s family pays a visit to the brideâ€™s family to announce their intent to marry from that home, and
              also parade the prospective groom.
              
              If embraced, they will then visit a second time to pay dowry, usually a colorful ceremony with relatives, friends and
              delicacies served. The negotiations are a preserve for elders, and the groom himself does not say anything, and neither
              is the bride allowed in the room.
              
              Successful negotiations are announced with ululations which soon turn into song and dance. Traditionally, bride price
              was paid with cows, goats and calves, but in these modern times money and other gifts are often accepted as a
              substitute.
              
              Dowry negotiations will then begin. The Kikuyu are well known for their â€˜veilingâ€™ of the bride where before negotiations
              can begin a group of veiled girls is brought out for the groom to pick his bride.
              
              Failure to pick the right one results in a fine, such as of a cow or goat

              Like many other aspects of Culture, modernization continues to water down traditions that were held in high
              regard. Religion, primarily Christianity has also impacted the way things are done. Death, while unwelcome, carried some
              of the most complicated rituals among different Bantu tribes. One ritual that stood out is the wailing.
              
              After a death was announced visitors would trickle into the deceased compound, wailing and crying, calling out to the
              dead and talking to his body (which was kept in a house in the compound).
              
              A few days after the burial close relatives would shave their hair to mark the end of the mourning period and the
              beginning of a new life. The impact of Christianity has reduced most of these traditional rituals and modernity has made
              them look â€˜backwardâ€™.
              
              For most tribes now, when a person dies he is taken to a mortuary and buried after a few days without any significant
              rituals being performed.

              Food is an important aspect of culture as it helps bring people together during different occasions. Generally speaking
              there are staple foods in diffrent bantu tribes that are eaten across the divide and especially more now as modernization trickles in
              and chips away at valued traditions of preparing food.
              
              These include rice, Ugali (corn bread), and chapatti (Indian bread similar to Nan). Traditionally, the Kikuyu often ate
              â€˜njahiâ€™ black beans mashed with sweet bananas and drank â€˜ucuru wa mukioâ€™, fermented porridge made from maize.
              
              While these foods are still treasured they have become delicacies and a preserve of big ceremonies such as weddings and
              celebrating child birth.
              
              The tribes of  Coastal bantus such as the Digo and Giriama pride themselves in â€˜Pilauâ€™ a rice and meat dish with
              spices. Regardless of tribe, most towns will welcome you with â€˜nyama chomaâ€™ or roast meat.
              
              The roasting and eating of goat/ sheep meat is a social
              activity that brings people together in a way that nothing else does.
              
              Whether in a homestead celebrating an occasion, of just a group of friends going out, nyama choma is social glue in
              Kenya. Its main accompaniments are usually Ugali and â€˜kachumbariâ€™ (kind of salsa made of tomatoes, onions, coriander and
              chili) and goes down well with Kenyaâ€™s most popular beer, Tusker.
              
              With westernization finding a firm grip in Kenya, now families have lunch at American fast food establishments such as
              KFC, Subway and Dominoâ€™s Pizza.

              African clothing and fashion is a diverse topic that is able to provide a look into different African cultures. Clothing
              varies from brightly colored textiles, to abstractly embroidered robes, to colorful beaded bracelets and necklaces.
              Since Africa is such a large and diverse continent, traditional clothing differs throughout each country. For example,
              many countries in West Africa have a â€œdistinct regional dress styles that are the products of long-standing textile
              crafts in weaving, dyeing, and printing", but these traditions are still able to coexist with western styles.[1] A large
              contrast in African fashion is between rural and urban societies. Urban societies typically are exposed more to trade
              and the changing world, while it takes more time for new western trends to get to rural areas

              and visiting during the Lamu Cultural Festival is a chance to experience Lamu life at its most exuberant and joyous.
              
              Each year, Lamu comes to life during the annual Lamu Cultural Festival. Several competitions and races are staged during
              this week long festival. These events are designed to each encourage local skills or practices that are central to Lamu
              life. These include traditional Swahili poetry, Henna painting and Bao competitionâ€¦ Bao is probably the oldest known
              game in human history, with archaeological evidence suggesting that the game has been played throughout Africa and the
              Middle East for thousands of years.
              
              In order to preserve and encourage the art of dhow sailing, now threatened by increasing availability of engines and
              prefabricated boats, a dhow race is also held. The townâ€™s finest dhows are selected to compete, and race under sail
              through a complicated series of buoys, combining speed with elaborate tacking and maneuvering skill.
